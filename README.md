# TAKEBACK
TAKEBACK is one of my first year projects at Queen's University Belfast. It is a HTML based text-driven game for the CSC1034 module. Featuring 7 different endings, you follow Detective House as he investigates a case of a corrupt Android. But when you unlock the context of the Android industrial revolution, whose side do you take?
