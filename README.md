# TAKEBACK
## Overview
TAKEBACK is one of my first year projects at Queen's University Belfast. It is a HTML based text-driven game for the CSC1034 module, created as part of a group project with five others.  
## Premise
Featuring 7 different endings, you follow Detective House as he investigates a case of a corrupt Android holding a wealthy businessman hostage. Choose where (and where not) to investigate as the clock ticks and human lives are on the line. As you find out more about the hostage and the impact he has had on the general public, including yourself, the stakes are raised. Do you do what you were hired for, or do you fight for what you think is right?

There's only one way to find out.
